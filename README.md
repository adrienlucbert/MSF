# MSF (MyCSFML)

This project is a well furnished C game engine, using the CSFML multi-media
library for graphics and audio.

## :checkered_flag: Context

Is was carried out during our first year of study at Epitech, to help us build games (runner,
tower defense, role-play game). It uses some concepts of modular C and object-oriented
programming to write generic code, easier to maintain and improve.

## :link: Constraints

During our first year at Epitech, we are forbidden to use the standard C library (we must recode it),
and we must follow a rather strict coding style (for instance, no more than 20 lines per function,
5 functions per file, and 80 columns per line).
The usage of the CSFML library is also imposed.

## :hammer: Build

The engine comes with a minimal demo project, to build it, clone the repository, `cd` into it and type `make`.

For further usage, the build produces 2 static libraries (libmy.a and libmsf.a), which must be linked together
with your project files.

## :warning: Notes

Please keep in mind this was done a few years ago, it does not meet our today's quality standards. It is however
still worth taking a look.
